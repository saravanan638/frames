            ice cream is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert. 
            It may be made from milk or cream and is flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice,
            such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit such as strawberries or peaches. It can also be made by whisking a flavored
            cream base and liquid nitrogen together.
