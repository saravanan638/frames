        evolution:
        <p style="color:lightgreen">Humans first learned to consume the milk of other mammals regularly following the domestication of animals during the 
        Neolithic Revolution or the development of agriculture. This development occurred independently in several global locations
        from as early as 9000–7000 BC in Mesopotamia to 3500–3000 BC in the Americas.People first domesticated the most important
         dairy animals – cattle, sheep and goats – in Southwest Asia, although domestic cattle had been independently derived from wild 
         aurochs populations several times since.</p>
